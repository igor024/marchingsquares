# marching squares
collab with alexfinger21 and thedarthdot/igor024

To try the demo, open index.html in your browser. Clicking starts and stops the animation

You can change the variables at the top of index.js
Render points: if you want the grid points to show up
numLayers: how many layers of noise you want
pointDist: resolution, a smaller value is a higher resolution
adjustableScale: a bigger value is gonna make the map look smaller
